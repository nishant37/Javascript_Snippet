Basics of Javascript

**Index.html**
In HTML we can add Javascript either by using Inline Script or by the external JS file.

**Variables and Datatypes**
Variable in JS is initialized with the var keyword.
This explains the variables used in the Javascript. If the variable used in JS is a
string then the value of string is in single colons.
Different data types in JS
1. Number
2. String
3. Boolean
4. Undefined
5. Null

Best practice is to give variables meaningful names.

Camel case notation is preferred in JS.

Variables cannot start with numbers and variables except for a $ sign or _ (underscore).

Cannot use Javascript reserved keywords as variable names.  

In Javascript there are two types of comments:-
1. Single Line Comments (//)
2. Multi Line Comment (/*     */)

**variable_mutation**

Javascript uses type coercion method to automatically convert datatypes to String
to join them together as one string.


Javascript automatically converts types from one another as it is needed.

Prompt is used in Javascript to get the values from user. The value from prompt can be stored in the variable.

**Operators**
Operators are functions that are written in a special way in Javascript.

Mathematical operators
1. - (Subtraction)
2. + (Addition)
3. * (Multiplication)
4. / (Division)

Logical Operators
1. ==  equal to
2. === equal value and equal type
3. != not equal
4. !== not equal value or equal type
5. > greater than
6. < less than
7. >= greater than or equal to
8. <= less than or equal to

TypeOf Operator
Tells us the type of operator

**Operator_Precedence**
1. Assignment and Exponent operators work from right-to-left
2. Math operators work from left-to-right


**If Else Statement**
1. In Javascript if Statement (===) is used to compare value as well as type.
2. If the boolean variable is used in if Statement then we don't have to write a condition.

**Boolean Logic**
Boolean Logic deals with true and false.

Several Logical Operators:
1. AND (&&) => true if all are true
2. OR (||) => true if one is true
3. NOT (!) => inverts true/false value

**Ternary Operator and Switch Statement**
In the ternary operator there is condition first then the if block and then there is else block.

Switch Statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

There can be multiple case clauses for the same code to be executed.

**Truthy and Falsy Values**
Falsy Values in Javascript includes 'Undefined', 'null', '0', ''(Empty Strings), 'Not a Number(NaN)'

Truthy Values: NOT Falsy Values

If/Else is the handy way to describe if value of variable is defined or not

**Functions**
Functions are like containers that hold some kind of code and we can pass arguments into the functions and then they can return the value.

For writing a function we write:

function function_name()

Functions helps us to not repeat our code again and again

We can call one function from another function.
